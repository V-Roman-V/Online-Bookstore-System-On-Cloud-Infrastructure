##  Online Bookstore System On Cloud Infrastructure
An online bookstore software projects that acts as a
central database containing various books in stock along
with their title, author and cost. This project is a website
that acts as a central book store. This web project has
front end, back and sql as a back-end. Such online
bookstores tend to get a large amount of online visitors.
In order to provide optimal performance and avoid site
crash the system needs to be hosted on a cloud
infrastructure. The sql database stores various book
related details. A user visiting the website can see a wide
range of books arranged in respective categories. The
user may select desired book and view its price. The user
may even search for specific books on the website. Once
the user selects a book , he then has to fill in a form and
the book is booked for the user. The system thus handles
a large amount of users with ease using azure based
cloud infrastructure.
